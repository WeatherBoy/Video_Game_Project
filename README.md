From the virgin Cosm the twin gods were born. Dethiom - a decrepit old thing, who would come to govern death, and Graiftic - his counterpart, weathered and brazen her name was yet to be synonymous with the season of winter.
They crawled forth into their newfound godhood, he only carrying a blue egg of vivid patterns and her embracing a subtlety beating, smoldering heart.
With Dethiom's presence, the first mortals emerged. Unbound and without purpose, they roamed the icy dessert of Graiftic, aimlessly.

But the Cosm wasn't barren. Chaos resided, and it had a part yet to be played. For through the vile covenant between mortals and Chaos, Virstat was born. A young woman, who had managed to seek out Chaos, and shed her mortality, achieved divinity. Virstat brought nature to the world. Plains, jungles, forests, fields all came to be, in her name. The mortals thrived alongside nature and an era of tranquility ushered in.

Then a most peculiar thing happened. The Cosm fell in love with itself.
Viviren, a descendant of the once depraved mortals, was a paragon of beauty. Enchanted by this being, the Cosm manifested into Cerulion: shard of the Cosmos and God of the forge. Cerulion wielded the Dawnhammer and forged the first star, in an attempt to beguile the fair Viviren. Then as the star shed light on the world, the mortals came to know warmth and Viviren, through the Cosm's affection, gained her title as goddess of love.
