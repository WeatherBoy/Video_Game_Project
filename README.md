# VideoGame Project
This is a repository for making some kind of videogame project, using Godot as the main engine.

Currently there is no decided project.

## Workflow
### Branch Protection
We have **Branch protection** on our `main` branch, so we must make a pull request to be able to merge with `main`.

### Automatic Semantic Versioning (ASV)
If we follow the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) scheme for commit-messages, then we have ASV, which makes a nice `CHANGELOG.md` :sparkles:
