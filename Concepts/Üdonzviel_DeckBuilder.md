From the virgin Cosm the twin gods were born. Dethiom - a decrepit old thing, who would come to govern death, and Graiftic - his counterpart, weathered and brazen her name was yet to be synonymous with the season of winter.
They crawled forth into their newfound godhood, he only carrying a blue egg of vivid patterns and her embracing a subtlety beating, smoldering heart.
With Dethiom's presence, the first mortals emerged. Unbound and without purpose, they roamed the icy dessert of Graiftic, aimlessly.
